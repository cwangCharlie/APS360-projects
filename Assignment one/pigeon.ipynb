    "# From Pigeons to Artificial Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial neural networks draw inspiration from real neural networks.\n",
    "In order to understand deep learning using a \"top-down\"\n",
    "approach, we'll start with a familiar system capable of \n",
    "learning: a pigeon.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2015, researchers Levenson et al. from the University of California Davis\n",
    "trained pigeons to detect breast cancer. They show that the common pigeon \n",
    "can reliably distinguish between benign versus malignant tumors.\n",
    "The experimental setup is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"imgs/pigeon.jpg\" width=\"500\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "The researchers trained pigeons by showing an image of a magnified\n",
    "biopsy to a pigeon. The pigeon then pecks at one of two answer\n",
    "buttons, labelling the image as malignant (cancerous) or benign \n",
    "(not cancerous). If the pigeon chooses correctly, researchers reward\n",
    "it with a tasty food pellet.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can imagine that at the very beginning, the pigeons might peck\n",
    "randomly, perhaps not even pecking at the buttons at all. Eventually,\n",
    "the pigeon might accidentally peck at the correct button, and see a\n",
    "food pellet. This food pellet is extremely important, and is what\n",
    "guides the pigeon to change its behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a sense, training an artificial neural network is like training\n",
    "a pigeon. In both cases, we need to answer questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How will we reward the pigeon (neural network)?\n",
    "2. How do we train the pigeon (neural network)\n",
    "   quickly and efficiently? \n",
    "3. How do we know that the pigeon (neural network) did not just\n",
    "   memorize the pictures we show it?\n",
    "4. Are there ethical issues in trusting a pigeon (neural network)\n",
    "   to detect cancer?\n",
    "  \n",
    "In this chapter, we'll build an artificial pigeon instead of using\n",
    "a real one. Also, instead of using pigeons to detect cancer, we'll\n",
    "work on a simpler problem of categorizing digits.\n",
    "In order to use an artificial pigeon to solve our classification\n",
    "problem, we will need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Build an artificial pigeon -- or rather, an *artificial pigeon brain*\n",
    "2. Decide how to reward the artificial pigeon\n",
    "3. Decide how to train the artificial pigeon\n",
    "4. Determine how well our artificial pigeon performs the classification task\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at each problem in turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Pigeon Brain\n",
    "\n",
    "How does a pigeon \"work\"? How were pigeons able to link the visual features\n",
    "of the biopsy images to receiving the food pellets? We don't know everything\n",
    "about how pigeons work, but we do know this much:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The light emitted from the screen showing the biopsy images reaches the pigeon's retina.\n",
    "2. Each retinal cell sends signals to neurons attached to it.\n",
    "3. The neurons pass the information to other neurons that are a part of the bird's brain.\n",
    "4. The brain makes a decision about what action to take.\n",
    "5. Neurons send signals to various parts of the pigeon's body, which results in the pigeon pecking a button (or not).\n",
    "6. The pigeon observes the response of its environment. Its neural pathways and biochemistry change to adapt to the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of these steps remain a mystery as of early 2019.\n",
    "However, we do know a few things about how biological neurons work, and we will\n",
    "use that knowledge to build a mathematical model of an artificial neuron.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"imgs/Blausen_0657_MultipolarNeuron.png\" width=\"500\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure above shows the anatomy of a brain cell, called a **neuron**.\n",
    "For our purposes, the most important parts of the neuron are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **dendrites**, which are connected to other cells that provides information.\n",
    "- The **cell body**, which consolidates information from the dendrites.\n",
    "- The **axon**, which is an extension from the cell body that passes information to other cells.\n",
    "- The **synapse**, which is the area where the axon of one neuron and the dendrite of another connect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neurons pass information using **action potentials**. When a neuron is \"at rest\",\n",
    "there is a small voltage difference between the inside and outside of the cell.\n",
    "When a neuron receives \"information\" in its dendrites, the voltage difference along\n",
    "that part of the cell lowers. If the total activity in a neuron's dendrites lowers\n",
    "the voltage difference enough, the entire cell *depolarizes*. In other words,\n",
    "the neuron **fires**. The voltage signal spreads along the axon and to the synapse,\n",
    "then to the next cells. Depending\n",
    "on the total activity at the next cells' dendrites, the signal might continue to\n",
    "propagate.\n",
    "\n",
    "What does it mean when a particular neuron fires? This question, known as\n",
    "**neural decoding**, is very difficult to answer.  However, neuroscientists do\n",
    "know that cells in the *optic pathway* fire more in response to various visual\n",
    "stimuli. There are neurons that fire more when a particular retinal cell is\n",
    "excited. There are also neurons that fire more in response to specific edges,\n",
    "lines, angles, and movements. There are neurons in monkeys that fire\n",
    "selectively to hands and faces. In 2005, studies found evidence of cells that\n",
    "fire in response to particular people like Bill Clinton or Jennifer Aniston.\n",
    "These studies lead to the hypothesis of a \"grandmother cell\", a neuron that\n",
    "represents a complex but specific concept or object.\n",
    "\n",
    "The existence of such \"grandmother cells\" is still contested. Many\n",
    "believe that neuron firing patterns encode information only in a **distributed** fashion.\n",
    "That is, the firing of a single neuron does not have a particular meaning, but\n",
    "the firing pattern of a group of neurons do. The idea is akin to how if you\n",
    "look at the bit patterns of an encrypted file, the individual bit values mean very\n",
    "little on their own, without considerations of other bits in the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## An Artificial Pigeon Brain\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of modelling an artificial brain, we will make \n",
    "make the simplifying assumption that a \"grandmother cell\" exists. This cell\n",
    "is the *output* of our network, representing the prediction we wish to make.\n",
    "That is, if we are hoping to classify malignant vs benign biopsy scans, we will have\n",
    "an output neuron that will (hopefully) only fire in the presence of a malignant tumor,\n",
    "not a benign one. Our goal when training this *artificial neural network* is \n",
    "to make this output neuron behave the way we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also need to model neurons that read the *input*. In a biological brain,\n",
    "there are neurons that connect directly to retinal cells and activate when\n",
    "those cells activate. For our purposes, we will also have *input* neurons, one for\n",
    "each *pixel* in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input neurons need to be connected to the output in some way. In a biological brain,\n",
    "the connections between neurons are messy, and can contain loops. In our case,\n",
    "we will use a \"layered\" network, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"imgs/fcn.png\" width=\"200\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Each neuron will belong to a \"layer\", with the input neurons belonging to\n",
    "the first layer, and the output neuron belonging to the last layer. Each\n",
    "neuron will be connected to other neurons in the layers below and above.\n",
    "In the image above, there is an input layer, a **hidden layer**,\n",
    "and an output layer. The hidden layer receives information from the input layer,\n",
    "and passes information the output layer. In theory, we can have as many hidden layers\n",
    "as we want. The more hidden layers we have, the **deeper** our network.\n",
    "\n",
    "This \"layered\" **neural network architecture** is called a **fully-connected,\n",
    "feed-forward network**. It is **fully-connected** because neurons connect to \n",
    "all other neurons in the preceding and succeeding layer. It is **feed-forward**\n",
    "because information only flows in one direction: there is no information flow\n",
    "from a later layer back to an earlier layer. For historical reasons, this\n",
    "network architecture is also called a **multi-layer perceptron** (MLP).\n",
    "\n",
    "We have still yet to model the individual neurons themselves. We will use real numbers\n",
    "to represent the firing rate of neurons, or the neuron's **activation**.\n",
    "We interpret a high activation value to mean a very active neuron, and a low\n",
    "activation value to mean an inactive neuron.\n",
    "The activation of the input neuron is set to the intensity of\n",
    "the corresponding pixel. \n",
    "\n",
    "The degree to which a biological neuron's activation influences another is\n",
    "complex, and depends on the presence and absence of neurotransmitters, and other\n",
    "biochemical and biophysical factors. In our artificial neuron, we will summarize\n",
    "all those factors into one real number, called a **weight**.\n",
    "This number can be large or small, and\n",
    "can be positive or negative. The strength of connections between neurons will\n",
    "change and adjust during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, the activation of a neuron is a scaled sum of the activations of\n",
    "the neurons in the layer below. However, in a biological neuron, the total\n",
    "sum of activity in the dendrites needs to be above a threshold in order for\n",
    "the neuron to fire. We will model the (negative) threshold as another real\n",
    "value that we add (subtract) from the activation, and set all activation\n",
    "below zero to be zero. The threshold numbers, called *biases*, are different\n",
    "for each neuron, and will also change during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an implementation of the artificial pigeon brain in PyTorch.\n",
    "Don't worry if this code or the explanations don't make sense yet."

    "after all, have much larger brains than pigeons, and are trained using much\n",

    "Likewise, we don't know why the neural network\n",
    "made a particular decision, so there is no way of verifying whether its reasoning \n",
    "is correct.\n",
    "The lack of interpretability of artificial neural networks is one of the many\n",
    "reasons preventing its more widespread use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Beyond Biological Pigeons\n",
    "\n",
    "Although biological pigeons motivated our network,\n",
    "training an artificial network is\n",
    "nothing like the kind of \"learning\" that might be biologically plausible.\n",
    "Artificial neural networks also do not have the same constraints as biological\n",
    "pigeons.\n",
    "For one, we can actually show a **batch** containing multiple images\n",
    "to the network at the same time, and only take one optimizer step for the\n",
    "entire batch. We can also train many different models, each with different\n",
    "settings, and choose the model that works the best.\n",
    "We will discuss these training considerations in the next few lectures."
